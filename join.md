The Shropshire Strummers meet every week somewhere in Shropshire to share our love of playing the ukulele. Take a look at the [calendar](/calendar) and join us.

Everyone is welcome and there are currently over 30 players who get together regularly to play everything from folk to punk. Songs are suggested by the group and if we can work out the chords we will usually give it a go.

We welcome absolute beginners who are usually bashing out a chord or three by the end of the night.

Call Adrian (The Great Leader) on 07904 624357 or join our [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shropshirestrummers).
