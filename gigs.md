The Shropshire Strummers are happy to play at gigs and sing-a-long events.  

Call Lesley on 01694 722459.

We are a voluntary group and play for the fun of it so we don't charge but we do ask for a contribution to our favourite charity, [The Mayfair Community Centre](http://www.mayfaircentre.org.uk/).
