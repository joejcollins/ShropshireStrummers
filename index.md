Children across the country have been casting aside their recorders and are taking up the ukulele instead.  Adults who haven’t played a musical instrument for years are finding the ukulele is fun and easy to play.  Now the ukulele can be heard all across Shrophire.
 
The Shropshire Strummers meet every week (Calendar), to sing and enjoy learning to play this entertaining little instrument.
 
Why not join us and follow in the steps of other famous ukulele players like George Harrison, Brian Wilson, Brian May, Eric Clapton and Marilyn Monroe.
 
Call Adrian (The Great Leader) on 07904 624357 or join our Mailing List.  No experience necessary, we'll even lend you a ukulele.
